## Web app for managing teacher's assistant applications for students and professors (School project) 

(Class name and university not included at professor's request to reduce the likelihood of future students plagarizing.)

This was a semester-long group project to build a web app using the agile software development methodology.
The app was built using Flask, SQLAlchemy, jQuery, and Bootstrap.

**NOTE:** As part of the assignment requirements, each 'sprint' is in a separate branch, and is not merged to master. The final product is in the **'Iteration-3'** branch.
